<h1>Labs 3 and 4</h1>
<h2>Lab 3:</h2>
Description: In this work, you have to make a simple presentation part of a website - View Page <br>

● Sort of your items option (sort by tree price )<br>
● Search option (search by tree material) <br>
● Count total amount of some of the field (total price of the trees) <br><br>
Requirements:<br>
● Responsiveness absolutely not required.<br>
● Styling is not important at all. Is up to you. <br><br><br>
<h2>Lab 4:</h2>
Description: In this work, you need to continue working and add two new parts to your website - Create & Edit Pages <br>
Also you must validate the forms using HTML attributes (inputs must be configured for your data format).<br>
If incorrect data is entered in the inputs, you must use JavaScript to inform the user with modal windows or just plain alert() function.<br>
Bonus points are provided for this work, if you implement a styled modal window that will work with JavaScript.<br><br>
Requirements:<br>
● Responsiveness absolutely not required.<br>
