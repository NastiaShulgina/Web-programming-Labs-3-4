<h2>CRUD Javascript App: Backend</h2>
● Description:<br>
In the last part of working on the website you have to implement all Create/Read/Update/Delete operations which must be made via the corresponding HTTP methods in your REST API.<br>
● Important. You don't have to make a backend from the beginning - connect an existing one that you worked on in the first year.<br>
If you don’t have a backend server, you should create a new REST API using any preferred technology.<br>
